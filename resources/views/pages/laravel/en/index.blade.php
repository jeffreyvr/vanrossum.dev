## Why I use Laravel
[Laravel](https://laravel.com) is a very popular PHP framwork developed by Taylor Otwell. The framework
allows you to work quickly and is suitable for both simple and complex applications. The framework is
also ideal for creating API's.

I have worked with other frameworks in the past (Symfony, CodeIgniter), but Laravel is by far the
most pleasant to work with. The framework also makes the application of [_Test Driven
Development_](https://www.madetech.com/blog/9-benefits-of-test-driven-development) very accessible. I
like to apply this method, because by thoroughly testing your code you can avoid unnecessary errors.
