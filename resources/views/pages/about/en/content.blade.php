                At a very early age, while I was still in kindergarten, I started building websites. Okay, maybe that's a little exaggerated, but with thirteen years old I was still pretty young.
                I made countless hobby websites and building sites quickly became a passion. Through the years, by studying and gaining work experience, I kept on developing my skills.

                Since 2011, I started working as a full time webdeveloper and since 2019 as a freelancer. My primairy language is PHP and I have specialised in Laravel and WordPress- development. I like to use front-end tools like Tailwind CSS and Alpine.js. I also make contributions to open source projects which can be found on GitHub.

                Aside from programming I love traveling, playing padel and do regularly attempt to play guitar. ðŸŽ¸
