                    I'm Jeffrey van Rossum, freelance PHP developer with over 10 years of WordPress experience. Over the
                    years I have worked on many websites with WordPress, including custom plugins and themes.
                </p>

## Why WordPress?
[WordPress](https://wordpress.org) is the most widely used CMS in the world. With WordPress you can
realize a fully operational website in no time. In addition, the basic functionality of WordPress is
extensible with plugins.

There are plenty of plugins and themes, but sometimes you need customization. As a WordPress developer I
have developed several custom plugins. For example, for a company in the publishing industry, I worked
on a subscription plugin that synchronizes subscriptions to a CRM system. I have developed several
[open-source](https://profiles.wordpress.org/jeffreyvr/#content-plugins) plugins for WordPress.
