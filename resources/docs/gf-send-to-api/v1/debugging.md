# Debugging

## Enable logging

To enable logging, simply enable it within the Gravity Forms settings page.

- Access the Settings page by hovering over Forms on the left side menu within your WordPress dashboard, then click on Settings
- Next, scroll down to Logging and set it to On.

Once complete, donâ€™t forget to save your settings.

Once logging is enabled within your Gravity Forms settings, an additional Settings item will appear labeled Logging. To configure any settings related to logging in Gravity Forms, simply access this tab.

## Detailed logging

You may configure what is logged by going to `Forms` -> `Settings` -> `Send to API`.

When logging is enabled, these elements will be included in the debug log. Note that, depending on your use case, the logs might contain sensitive information.

You can log:
- Body
- Headers
- Response
