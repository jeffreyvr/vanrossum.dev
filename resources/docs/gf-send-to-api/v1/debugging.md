# Debugging

## Enable logging

To enable logging, head on over to the Gravity Forms settings page.

- You'll find the Settings page under `Forms` -> `Settings`
- Next, scroll down to Logging and toggle it on

Don't forget to save the page.

Once logging is enabled, an additional Settings item will appear labeled `Logging`. This is where you'll find the logs.

## Detailed logging

You may configure what is logged by going to `Forms` -> `Settings` -> `Send to API`.

When logging is enabled, these elements will be included in the debug log. Note that, depending on your use case, the logs might contain sensitive information.

You can log:
- Body
- Headers
- Response
